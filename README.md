# VBA-Challenge
## Project Overview

Steve wants to analyze stock data to advise his parents on future investments. For Steve to analyze different sets of stock in the future, we are automating this process by creating a flexible macro for running multiple stocks for future analysis. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. For this challenge, we are editing or refactoring our Stock Market Dataset so Steve can expand his analysis to include the entire stock market. Once refactored, we will determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

## Results
I began the refactoring of the code by inputting the provided, initial code. I then added, removed or edited the code for more efficiency. 





## Summary
### Advantages & Disadvantages of Refactoring Code 
Refactoring a code allows us to take fewer steps, use less memory or improve the logic of the code to make it easier for others to interpret. Improving efficiency in a code is a major advantage to refactoring code and can result in design & software improvement and faster programming. A disadvantage of refactoring code is more room for error, the purpose is to improve the code efficiency, when refactoring we can easily add the wrong formula, variable or set the wrong data type which as a result can ruin the entire code and will not allow it to run properly.  

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
When refactored properly, the efficiency of the code improved and as a result decreased the Macro running time. A con is entering the wrong loop variable and not improving the original macro at all, by ruining the original VBA script which didnâ€™t allow me to run the macro at all, which was my case. 

When refactored properly, below are the results of the successfully run macro.
