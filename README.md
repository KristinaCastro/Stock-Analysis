# VBA-Challenge-
## Project Overview

Steve wants to analyze stock data to advise his parents on future investments. To be able to analyze different sets of stock in the future, we are automating this process for Steve by creating a felixible macro for running multiple stocks for future analysis. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. For this challenge, we are editing or refactoring our Stock Market Dataset so Steve can expand his analysis to include the entire stock market. Once refactored, we will determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster.
